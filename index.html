      <h2>Why suCSS?</h2>
      <p>The modern web is often burdened by bulky frameworks, packing excessive features that go unused. For instance, while Bootstrap's minified CSS weighs a hefty 200KB, suCSS is a mere 8KB.</p>
      <p>Despite its lightweight nature, suCSS doesn't compromise on aesthetics or functionality. It empowers web developers to swiftly create visually appealing sites without the bloat of complex frameworks.</p>
      <p>By embracing suCSS, developers can easily establish a solid foundation for their projects or utilize it as-is for clean and polished websites. While frameworks like Bootstrap have their place, suCSS shines for modest or personal projects where simplicity reigns supreme, This website itself is crafted solely with <b>semantic HTML</b>, devoid of any classes or IDs.</p>
      <p>My journey with suCSS began while experimenting with static site generators. Seeking a lightweight solution for my personal websites, I developed a straightforward CSS template. This template later evolved into a theme for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.getzola.org">Zola</a> called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.getzola.org/themes/anemone/">anemone</a>. Recognizing its potential utility to others, suCSS emerged as a standalone refined and minimalist CSS framework.</p>
